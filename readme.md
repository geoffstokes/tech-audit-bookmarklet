## Get it

Get it from the [GitHub Page](http://ticky.github.io/tech-audit-bookmarklet).

## Developing

Fork and clone the repo, make changes to `tech-audit.js`.

#### Useful commands

* Run `yarn lint` to check for linter errors.
* Run `yarn build` to build the bookmarklet file in `docs/`.
* Run `yarn serve` to test the bookmarklet page and new bookmarklet.

#### Adding new technologies

_Copying an existing test is advisable._

* Add a detection for the framework
  - Client side frameworks are detected by looking at
    variable definitions with `isDeeplyDefined()` or DOM elements with `elementExists()`
  - Server side frameworks are detected by inspecting request headers
* Report the detected framework
  - Client side frameworks are reported by calling `clientSideListAdd()`
  - Server side frameworks are reported by calling `serverSideListAdd()`
  - Provide the official name of the framework as the first parameter. If available, provide the version as a second parameter.
